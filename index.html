			<p> &emsp; I'm Alex Appleby. I'm currently a senior at Aspen High School, located in Aspen,
				CO. I primarily program in Java. I'm the captain and founder of FIRST Tech Challenge
				team 16896, Black Forest Robotics, one of the best FTC teams in the world. My primary role
				on the team is software, but I also enjoy design and strategy.
				<br>
				<br>
				&emsp; Outside of FTC, I'm a hardcore computer nerd and a Linux enthusiast.
				I ususally use Mint, Manjaro, or Debian, and I'm a sucker for doing
				things in the command line. Instead of Google, I use NightHawk, my own
				Searx-based metasearch engine.
				<br>
				<br>
				&emsp;My code is like my website: Simple, efficient, and elegant.
